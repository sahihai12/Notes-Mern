## What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a statically typed, compiled superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript, making it easier to develop large-scale applications. It is developed and maintained by Microsoft.

## Key Features of TypeScript

### 1. Static Typing
TypeScript allows you to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values. Types help catch errors at compile time rather than runtime.
```typescript
let username: string = "John"; // username must be a string
let age: number = 30; // age must be a number
```

### 2. Type Inference
TypeScript can infer the type of a variable based on its assigned value, so you don’t always need to explicitly declare types.

```typescript
let username: string = "John"; // username must be a string
let age: number = 30; // age must be a number
```


### 2. Interfaces
TypeScript can infer the type of a variable based on its assigned value, so you don’t always need to explicitly declare types.

```typescript
let username: string = "John"; // username must be a string
let age: number = 30; // age must be a number
```

### 3. Type Inference
Interfaces define the shape of an object, describing the types of properties it should have. They allow better structure and enforce consistency.


```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const user: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};
```

### 4. Classes and Inheritance

TypeScript extends JavaScript’s class syntax with features such as private and protected modifiers and implements interfaces.

```typescript
class Person {
  private name: string;
  constructor(name: string) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  private role: string;
  constructor(name: string, role: string) {
    super(name);
    this.role = role;
  }
}

```

### 5. Generics
Generics allow you to create reusable, flexible components and functions that can work with multiple data types.


```typescript
let username: string = "John"; // username must be a string
let age: number = 30; // age must be a number
```

### 6. Enums
Enums are a way to define named constants, making it easier to handle sets of related values.

```typescript
enum Color {
  Red = 1,
  Green = 2,
  Blue = 3
}
let c: Color = Color.Green;
```

### 7.  Union Types
TypeScript allows variables to hold values of different types by using union types.

```typescript
let value: string | number = "Hello";
value = 42;
```

### 8. Type Aliases
Type aliases allow you to define a new name for an existing type. It can be used to create more readable code or complex types.
```typescript
type ID = string | number;

let userId: ID = "123";
userId = 456;

```

### 9. Type Assertions
Type assertions allow you to tell TypeScript to treat a variable as a specific type, bypassing type inference.

```typescript
let someValue: any = "Hello";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;
```

### 10. Modules
TypeScript uses ES6-style modules. You can use import and export to share code between different files.

```typescript
// File: math.ts
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

// File: main.ts
import { add } from './math';
console.log(add(2, 3));
```
