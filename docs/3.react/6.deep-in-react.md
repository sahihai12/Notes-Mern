> <span style={{color: '#ff00a9'}}>Real DOM</span>, also known as the actual DOM, is the browser’s representation of a web page’s HTML structure. When a user interacts with a web page, such as clicking a button or filling out a form, the browser updates the Real DOM to reflect the changes. The browser then re-renders the page to display the updated HTML.

### Virtual DOM
> The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM that React keeps in memory to optimize rendering. When the state of a component changes, React creates a new VDOM tree, compares it with the previous one, and calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM.

    **Purpose**: The VDOM minimizes direct manipulation of the real DOM, which is slow. By using the VDOM, React only updates what has actually changed, improving performance, especially in large applications.
    
    **How it Works**: When a component updates, React:
        - Creates a new VDOM representation.
        - Compares it with the previous VDOM.
        - Finds differences and updates only the changed elements in the actual DOM.

### Reconciliation
> Reconciliation is the process by which React updates the DOM to match the current VDOM. It’s the algorithm used by React to figure out which parts of the DOM need to be changed.

    ** How it Works**:
        - When a component’s state or props change, React generates a new VDOM tree.
        - React then compares the new VDOM tree with the previous one using a "diffing" algorithm.
        - Based on this comparison, React applies only the necessary updates to the real DOM, a process known as "reconciliation."

    ** Key Points **:
        - React optimizes reconciliation by assuming that components at the same level in the tree have the same structure.
        - This algorithm can efficiently handle most updates, but for performance-critical cases (like reordering lists), you might need to help React by using unique key props on list items.

### Hydration
> Hydration is the process of attaching event listeners to a pre-rendered HTML markup (often generated on the server) to make it interactive on the client side.

    **Purpose**: Hydration is typically used in server-side rendering (SSR) applications. In SSR, the server sends fully-rendered HTML to the browser. When the browser receives this HTML, React takes over, making the page interactive without needing to fully re-render the content.

    ** How it Works**:
        - The server renders the app and sends the HTML to the client.
        - The client loads JavaScript and initializes React components on top of the existing HTML.
        - React then “hydrates” this HTML by adding event listeners and making it interactive without re-rendering the content.

    ** Key Points**:
        - Hydration is a performance-optimization strategy, making initial page loads faster, especially on slower connections or devices.
        - React provides ReactDOM.hydrate instead of ReactDOM.render for hydration.

:::note
The <span style={{color: '#ff00a9'}}>diffing algorithm</span> is a key part of React’s reconciliation process. When the state of a component changes, React uses the diffing algorithm to efficiently update the actual DOM by comparing the current virtual DOM (VDOM) tree with the previous one and applying only the necessary changes.

### Controlled & UnControlled Components

> <span style={{color: '#ff00a9'}}>Controlled Components</span> is an element whose value is controlled by React state. React fully manages the value of the input field or form element and updates it through state changes.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledComponent() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setInputValue(e.target.value);  // Update state on every change
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input 
        type="text" 
        value={inputValue}    // Controlled by React state
        onChange={handleChange}  // Event handler to update state
      />
      <p>You typed: {inputValue}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ControlledComponent;
```

> <span style={{color: '#ff00a9'}}>Uncontrolled Components</span>  is an element whose value is not controlled by React state. Instead, the DOM itself manages the value of the input, and React accesses the value using a ref (reference).
```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert('Input value: ' + inputRef.current.value);  // Accessing the input value via ref
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />  {/* Uncontrolled input */}
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default UncontrolledComponent;

```
