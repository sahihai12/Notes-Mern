### 1. What are the differences between functional and class components in React?

* **Answer**: Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and use this.state and this.setState() for managing state, whereas functional components are simpler and don’t have lifecycle methods or state by default. However, with React Hooks, functional components can now manage state (useState) and lifecycle (useEffect), making them more concise and generally more performant than class components. React prefers functional components due to these benefits.

### 2. Explain the use of useMemo and useCallback hooks and how they differ.

* **Answer**: Both useMemo and useCallback are hooks used to optimize performance by memoizing values. useMemo is used to memoize the result of a function so it is only recalculated when dependencies change, while useCallback memoizes the function itself to prevent unnecessary re-creations, useful when passing callbacks to child components. useMemo returns a computed value, whereas useCallback returns a memoized function.

### 3. How does React’s reconciliation process work?

* **Answer**: React’s reconciliation algorithm, also known as the "diffing algorithm," identifies what parts of the DOM need to be updated by comparing the previous and new Virtual DOM representations. It assigns unique keys to elements and only re-renders nodes that have changed. This minimizes direct DOM manipulation, making rendering efficient and fast.

### 4. Describe error boundaries and how they work in React.

* **Answer**: Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and log them, preventing them from crashing the entire application. Error boundaries are implemented using the componentDidCatch lifecycle method in class components or by using React’s ErrorBoundary component in functional components. They can only catch errors in the component rendering phase, not in event handlers or asynchronous code.

### 5. What is React’s Context API, and when should you use it?

* **Answer**: The Context API allows you to create global variables (or contexts) that can be accessed throughout a component tree without having to pass props at each level. It’s ideal for passing down data like themes, authenticated user info, or locale preferences. However, frequent updates to the context can cause performance issues due to re-renders in consuming components.

### 6. What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and how do they differ from custom hooks?

* **Answer**: HOCs are functions that take a component and return an enhanced component, adding additional functionality or props to the original component. They allow code reuse and separation of concerns but are limited to wrapping components. Custom hooks, on the other hand, are reusable functions for logic and stateful behavior that can be used directly within functional components, avoiding the need for an additional layer like HOCs.

### 7. Explain the concept of code-splitting in React and its advantages.

* **Answer**: Code-splitting allows you to split your codebase into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand, reducing the initial bundle size and improving load times. React’s React.lazy and Suspense make it easy to implement code-splitting by dynamically loading components only when they are needed. Code-splitting is beneficial for large applications, reducing load times and enhancing performance by only loading what’s necessary for the current view.

### 8. What are portals in React, and why would you use them?

* **Answer**: React portals allow you to render components outside the DOM hierarchy of their parent component. This is useful for elements like modals, tooltips, or dropdowns that need to appear above all other elements. Portals are created using ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container), where child is the component you want to render, and container is the DOM node where it will be rendered.

### 9. Describe how you would implement server-side rendering (SSR) in React.

* **Answer**: Server-side rendering in React involves rendering the initial HTML of a React component on the server and sending it to the client. This can improve performance, SEO, and load times, especially for initial page loads. Tools like Next.js or Express with ReactDOMServer.renderToString() are often used to set up SSR in React projects. SSR requires additional handling for state hydration and asynchronous data fetching.

### 10. What is React.memo and when would you use it?

* **Answer**: React.memo is a higher-order component that prevents a functional component from re-rendering if its props haven’t changed. This is useful in performance optimization, especially for components that receive the same props frequently or have expensive rendering logic. It performs a shallow comparison by default, but you can pass a custom comparison function for more complex comparisons.

### 11. Explain what hooks rules are and why they’re important.

* **Answer**: Hooks must follow two rules: (1) Only call hooks at the top level of a component or custom hook to maintain consistent execution order, and (2) Only call hooks within React functional components or custom hooks to avoid issues in lifecycle management and context. Violating these rules can lead to unpredictable behavior and bugs in the app’s rendering.

### 12. What are some common performance optimization techniques in React?

* **Answer**: Performance optimization techniques in React include:  
* Using React.memo for memoizing functional components  
* Leveraging useMemo and useCallback hooks to avoid re-renders  
* Code-splitting and lazy-loading components  
* Implementing server-side rendering for initial load speed  
* Using React.Fragment to avoid unnecessary DOM nodes  
* Avoiding anonymous functions as props in frequently re-rendered components  
* Utilizing tools like Profiler for tracking component performance


### 13. Architecture Patterns

#### a. Component-Based Architecture

* **Reusable Components**: Each component focuses on a single piece of the UI and is reusable. They are categorized as presentational or container components.  
* **Page Components**: Components in the pages directory represent routes and serve as entry points for each feature or view in the app.  
* **Feature-Based Folders**: Organizing components based on features or domains (e.g., Auth or Dashboard) makes it easier to scale the project as new features are added.

#### b. Container and Presentational Components

* **Presentational Components**: These components handle UI rendering, layout, and styling. They don’t contain business logic or manage data but receive data through props (e.g., Button, Header).  
* **Container Components**: These components manage data fetching, business logic, and connect to the Redux store or API endpoints. They then pass data as props to presentational components.

#### c. Hooks-Based Architecture

* **Custom Hooks**: hooks directory contains custom React hooks to encapsulate reusable logic (e.g., useAuth, useFetch).  
* **React Context**: The context folder contains custom contexts for managing app-wide state using React's Context API.  
* **Global State**: Redux or other state management libraries (like Zustand) are often used when more complex state management is needed.

### 3. Global State Management (Redux or Context)

* **Redux**: For larger applications, Redux helps manage complex state. Redux logic is often modularized by slices, each handling a specific feature.  
* **Context API**: For smaller projects, the React Context API can manage global state without additional libraries.

### 4. API Layer

* The api folder centralizes all API calls. This separation keeps API logic organized and reusable across the application.  
* A custom apiClient (e.g., using Axios) configures base URLs, headers, and interceptors in a single location.

### 5. Routing

* **React Router**: Pages in the pages folder represent routes, and React Router helps manage navigation.  
* **Protected Routes**: Use higher-order components or custom route components to handle authentication and role-based access.

### 15. What is lazy loading 
> Lazy loading is a design pattern used in software development, particularly in web development, to defer the loading of resources (such as images, scripts, or components) until they are actually needed. Instead of loading everything when the page is first loaded, lazy loading only loads the resource when it comes into view or when it is required by the user. This approach helps improve performance, reduce initial page load time, and save bandwidth.
```jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <LazyComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}

```


### 16. Why Use const and Not let for useState?
> In React, when you use the useState hook, you generally define the state variable and its setter function like this:
```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

Here’s why const is used instead of let:

- const is a variable declaration that ensures that the reference to the array (which holds the state and its setter function) remains constant. The value of count will change over time (due to setCount), but the reference to the [count, setCount] array will not change.

The reference to the array ([count, setCount]) should stay the same throughout the component's lifecycle. Using let could lead to confusion, as let allows reassigning the reference to a new value, which is not necessary here.

- Immutability: Even though count will change when you call setCount, the reference to the array (the state tuple) does not need to be reassigned. React optimizes the rendering process and relies on the constancy of the state reference for performance.

So, const is the correct choice to avoid accidental reassignment, which aligns with React’s philosophy of immutability and predictability.

### 17. Why in react arr.map works to render jsx but filter does not.
filter() creates a new array with all elements that pass a certain condition. It doesn't transform the elements; it only includes or excludes them based on the condition.

```jsx
const items = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
const filteredItems = items.filter((item) => item.length > 5);
// filteredItems is ['banana', 'orange'], still an array of strings, not JSX
```
even if you return different values let say
```jsx
const items = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
const filteredItems = items.filter((item) => item === "apple"); // ['apple']

const filteredItems = items.filter((item) => (item === "apple" ? "YES" : "NO")); // ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

/* do you why because filter will return values automatically filter will covert "YES" and "NO" into true and  false. since both are true filter will return all items ,
but if you will return 1 and 0 

*/
const filteredItems = items.filter((item) => (item === "apple" ? "YES" : 0)); // ["apple"]

// "YES" will convert to true and 0 will convert to false
```

### 18. Webpack vs Babel
- Webpack is a module bundler that bundles your code, styles, and assets into optimized output files. It helps manage dependencies and includes tools like loaders and plugins.
- Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows you to write modern JavaScript and JSX while ensuring compatibility with older browsers. Babel transforms your code into something all browsers can understand.
  
  * Together, Webpack and Babel enable you to build modern JavaScript applications using React (or other libraries) while ensuring compatibility and optimized performance for production. *
