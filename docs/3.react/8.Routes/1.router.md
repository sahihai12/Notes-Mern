### React Router DOM
> React Router is a powerful library for handling navigation in React applications. It enables you to implement client-side routing, allowing you to render different components based on the URL path.

#### Step 1: Install React Router
```
npm install react-router-dom
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Your Routes
    1. App.js - This file contains the routing logic.
    2. Home.js, About.js, and Contact.js - These are the components that will be rendered when the user navigates to different paths.

    ```
    /src
    /components
        Home.js
        About.js
        Contact.js
    App.js
    index.js
    ```

#### Step 4: Set Up Routing in App.js
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    import Home from './components/Home';
    import About from './components/About';
    import Contact from './components/Contact';

    function App() {
    return (
        <Router>
        <div>
            {/* Navigation Links */}
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
                    <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
                    <li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>

            {/* Routes */}
            <Switch>
                <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
                <Route path="/about" component={About} />
                <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
            </Switch>
        </div>
        </Router>
    );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

Explanation of App.js:
- `<BrowserRouter as Router>`: This is the Router that uses the HTML5 history API to keep the UI in sync with the URL.
- `<Link>`: This is used to navigate between different routes. Unlike an anchor (`<a>`) tag, it does not cause a page reload.
- `<Switch>`: This ensures that only one route is rendered at a time. The first matching `<Route>` is rendered.
- `<Route>`: This defines a route in the app. The path prop specifies the URL path, and the component prop specifies which component to render for that path.
- `exact`: The exact prop ensures that only the route that exactly matches the URL is rendered. For example, without exact, the / route would match any URL, which is not desired.

#### Summary of React Router Hooks: [To know more](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-routes)
- useNavigate: Used for programmatically navigating to different routes (React Router v6).
- useHistory: Used for programmatic navigation (React Router v5).
- useParams: Accesses dynamic route parameters from the URL.
- useLocation: Provides information about the current URL, including query parameters.
- useMatch: Checks if the current URL matches a specific path.
- useQuery: Although not a built-in hook, you can create custom hooks to work with query strings (see useLocation to extract query params).
- useNavigate: Redirects based on state change or any condition.

### Nested and Fallback Routes
- Nested Routes: You use nested `<Route>` components inside the parent route to handle paths like /dashboard/overview and /dashboard/settings.
- Fallback Route: The Route without a path acts as a fallback for unknown paths, typically used for 404 pages.
