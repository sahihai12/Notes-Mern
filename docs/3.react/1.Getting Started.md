> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's primarily used for creating reusable UI components.

### Advantage of react over vanilla js
* React vs. Vanilla JS
    - Component-Based: React uses reusable components, while vanilla JS requires manual DOM manipulation and state management.
    - Declarative UI: React automatically updates the UI based on state changes, while vanilla JS requires direct DOM updates.
    - Efficient DOM Updates: React uses a Virtual DOM for faster updates, while vanilla JS directly manipulates the real DOM, which can be slower.
    - Ecosystem: React has a rich ecosystem with tools for routing, state management, etc., whereas vanilla JS lacks built-in solutions for these.
    - Development Speed: React simplifies development with its component model and state management, while vanilla JS requires more code and manual management.

### React 18 feature 
1. Concurrent Rendering
    > Allows React to prepare multiple UI updates simultaneously without blocking the main thread. 
    > Improves app responsiveness by letting React work on background updates and only commit when ready.
2. Automatic Batching
Batches multiple state updates into a single render, even within asynchronous functions.
Reduces re-renders, improving performance by grouping updates.

```jsx
setCount(c => c + 1);
setFlag(f => !f); // Both updates batch into one render in React 18
```
3. Transitions API
Separates urgent and non-urgent updates (e.g., page navigation vs. data fetching).
Enhances user experience by prioritizing critical updates.

```jsx
import { useTransition } from 'react';

const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

startTransition(() => {
  setData(newData);
});
```
4. useId Hook
Generates unique IDs for components to prevent ID clashes, even across server and client rendering.
Useful for form elements and accessibility labels.
Example:

```jsx
import { useId } from 'react';

const id = useId(); // Unique, stable ID for client and server
```
