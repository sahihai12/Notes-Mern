title: Generator & Decorator
---


### **Generator**  
Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing for iterative computation or lazy evaluation of data sequences. They are defined using function\* syntax and yield values using the yield keyword. Generators are particularly useful for writing iterators and asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way  


### **Decorators**  
Decorators are a feature of JavaScript that allow you to wrap or modify classes and their properties/methods to add behaviour or modify functionality. Decorators are typically used in frameworks like TypeScript or with Babel (with plugins) to extend and modify classes in a flexible way.

```js 
// Step 1: Create a generator function
function* numberGenerator(limit) {
    for (let i = 1; i <= limit; i++) {
        yield i;
    }
}

// Step 2: Create a decorator that logs each yielded value
function logGenerator(generatorFunction) {
    return function* (...args) {
        const generator = generatorFunction(...args);
        for (const value of generator) {
            console.log(`Yielded: ${value}`); // Log the value
            yield value; // Yield the value to the caller
        }
    };
}

// Step 3: Use the decorator
const decoratedGenerator = logGenerator(numberGenerator);

// Use the decorated generator
const gen = decoratedGenerator(5);

for (const num of gen) {
    console.log(`Received: ${num}`);
}
// Yielded: 1
// Received: 1
// Yielded: 2
// Received: 2
// Yielded: 3
// Received: 3
// Yielded: 4
// Received: 4
// Yielded: 5
// Received: 5

```

```
Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing you to handle asynchronous programming or manage complex state flows. They are defined using the function* syntax and yield values using the yield keyword.
