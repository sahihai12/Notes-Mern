### What is a Database (DB)?
> A database (DB) is an organized collection of structured information, or data, that is stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are managed by database management systems (DBMS), allowing users to create, read, update, and delete data. The data is often organized in a way that makes it easily accessible and allows for efficient querying.

### Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases

* Relational Databases <span style={{color: '#ff00a9'}}>(RDBMS)</span>
    - Structure: Data is organized into tables (rows and columns), where each row represents a unique data entry, and each column represents a data attribute. Tables can be linked via foreign keys.
    - Schema: Predefined schema with strict rules for data storage.
    - Query Language: SQL (Structured Query Language).
    - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
    - Best For: Scenarios with structured data and relationships, like banking systems or CRM systems where consistency is critical.

* Non-Relational Databases <span style={{color: '#ff00a9'}}>(NoSQL)</span>
    - Structure: Flexible schema. Data is stored in various forms like documents, key-value pairs, wide-columns, or graphs.
    - Schema: No predefined schema; structure can evolve.
    - Query Language: Does not use SQL (though some NoSQL databases provide SQL-like query languages).
    - Examples: MongoDB (document), Redis (key-value), Cassandra (wide-column), and Neo4j (graph).
    - Best For: Scenarios with unstructured data or large volumes, like social media, real-time analytics, and content management where flexibility and scalability are prioritized.


### ORM vs ODM

* ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
    - Purpose: Maps objects in code to tables in a relational database.
    - Usage: Primarily for relational databases (SQL-based).
    - Data Handling: Transforms data between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases.
    - Example ORMs: Sequelize (for Node.js), Hibernate (for Java), and Django ORM (for Python).

* ODM (Object-Document Mapping)
    - Purpose: Maps objects in code to documents in a non-relational (document-based) database.
    - Usage: Primarily for document-based NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
    - Data Handling: Converts data between code objects and document-oriented databases.
    - Example ODMs: Mongoose (for Node.js with MongoDB), Morphia (for Java with MongoDB).

::: note
- ORM: Works with SQL databases, mapping objects to tables.
- ODM: Works with NoSQL document databases, mapping objects to documents.

### Commands and its categories 
> In SQL, commands are categorized into different groups based on their functionalities: DDL, DML, DCL, and TCL. Each type serves a distinct purpose in database operations.


| Type | Purpose | Commands |
|------|---------|----------|
| **DDL** | Define or alter the structure of database objects | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE |
| **DML** | Manipulate data within tables | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE |
| **DCL** | Control user access and permissions | GRANT, REVOKE |
| **TCL** | Manage transactions for data integrity | COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT, SET TRANSACTION |

### Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to reduce data redundancy (duplicate data) and improve data integrity. The goal is to minimize the chances of anomalies when inserting, updating, or deleting data. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, manageable ones and defining relationships between them.

### ACID
The ACID principles ensure that database transactions are processed reliably and guarantee data integrity even in the event of system failures, crashes, or power loss. The ACID acronym stands for:
    1. Atomicity:
        - A transaction is either fully completed or fully rolled back.
        - No partial updates; the transaction is treated as a single unit.

    2. Consistency:
        - A transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, preserving data integrity and adhering to defined rules.
        - Ensures that the database maintains its integrity constraints after the transaction.

    3. Isolation:
        - Transactions are executed in isolation from each other.
        - The changes made by one transaction are not visible to others until the transaction is completed, ensuring no interference between concurrent transactions.

    4. Durability:
        - Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent and persist even if the system crashes or loses power.
        - Data is saved to permanent storage (e.g., disk), ensuring the transaction's effect is not lost.
