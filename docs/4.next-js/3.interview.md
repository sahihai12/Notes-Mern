## Basic

### 1. What is Next.js, and how does it differ from React? 
   * Explain that Next.js is a React framework focused on server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and file-based routing, allowing for better performance and SEO capabilities.  
### 2. What is the difference between SSR, SSG, and CSR (Client-Side Rendering) in Next.js? 
   * SSR: Generates HTML on each request on the server.  
   * SSG: Generates static HTML at build time, which is reused across requests.  
   * CSR: Renders content on the client side, like standard React behavior.  
### 3. How does Next.js handle routing? 
   * Discuss file-based routing, where page components are automatically created based on the file structure in the `pages` directory, and dynamic routes using brackets (e.g., `[id].js`).  
### 4. What is getStaticProps and when would you use it? 
   * `getStaticProps` is a Next.js function for SSG, allowing you to fetch data at build time. It’s used for pages where data does not change often or is static.  
### 5. What is getServerSideProps, and when should it be used? 
   * `getServerSideProps` enables SSR by fetching data on each request to the server. It’s ideal for pages where data frequently changes or is user-specific.  
### 6. What is getStaticPaths, and how does it work with dynamic routes? 
   * `getStaticPaths` works with dynamic routes in SSG, allowing you to predefine which paths should be generated at build time.

## Advanced Next.js Topics

### 7. How does API routing work in Next.js? 
   * Explain how `pages/api` provides serverless functions, enabling the creation of backend routes for handling requests directly within the Next.js application.  
### 8. What is ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) and how does it benefit Next.js apps? 
   * ISR allows Next.js to update static content after the initial build by re-rendering the page at specified intervals. This makes it ideal for apps that need fresh data but don’t want the overhead of SSR on every request.  
### 9. Explain the `next/image` component and its benefits. 
   * The `next/image` component optimises images with automatic resizing, lazy loading, and supports multiple formats. It enhances performance and user experience by serving the most efficient image size for different devices.  
### 10. How would you handle authentication in a Next.js application? 
    * Discuss approaches like using JWTs, integrating with libraries like `next-auth` for OAuth support, or creating custom authentication APIs using `pages/api`.  
### 11. What is the `next/link` component, and how does it improve navigation? 
    * `next/link` provides client-side routing with prefetching capabilities, allowing faster transitions and a more seamless user experience between pages.  
### 12. What is Middleware in Next.js, and how is it used? 
    * Middleware allows you to run custom logic before a request is completed, such as for authentication, redirects, or logging. Introduced in Next.js 12, it runs at the Edge, improving performance for operations close to the user.

## Performance Optimization and Best Practices

### 13. What are some ways to optimize Next.js performance? 
    * Discuss using `getStaticProps`/`getStaticPaths` where possible, using `next/image` for optimized images, implementing lazy loading for components and images, utilizing CDN caching, and enabling ISR.  
### 14. How does code splitting work in Next.js? 
    * Next.js automatically code splits by page, meaning each page only loads the JavaScript required for that specific route. Dynamic imports can also be used to split larger components.  
### 15. How can you enable or configure a custom 404 page in Next.js? 
    * By creating a `404.js` file in the `pages` directory, you can customize the error page that appears when a route doesn’t match any page.  
### 16. What is `next/head`, and how does it enhance SEO in Next.js? 
    * `next/head` allows you to manage metadata for each page, like titles, descriptions, and Open Graph tags, which is essential for SEO and social sharing previews.

## Edge Cases, Testing, and Deployment

### 17. How would you handle error boundaries in Next.js? 
    * Next.js has limited built-in support for error boundaries. You can implement them manually using React’s `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method in a custom error boundary component or use a higher-level component.  
### 18. How do you perform testing in a Next.js application? 
    * Discuss using Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests, Cypress for end-to-end tests, and how to handle mock data fetching for API routes in `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.  
### 19. What deployment options are available for a Next.js app? 
    * Next.js can be deployed on Vercel (native support), AWS, DigitalOcean, or any Node.js-compatible server. Explain the benefits of Vercel, like automatic deployments and serverless function support.  
### 22. Demonstrate how to use dynamic imports in Next.js to load a heavy component only when needed. 
    * In Next.js, you can use dynamic imports to load heavy components only when they are needed, which improves performance by reducing the initial page load size. Next.js provides a built-in `dynamic` function for this purpose.
