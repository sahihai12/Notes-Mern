### How TypeScript Works
1. Installation
    > TypeScript can be installed globally or locally via npm:
```
npm install -g typescript
```
2. Compiling
    > TypeScript files (.ts) need to be compiled into JavaScript (.js). This can be done using the TypeScript compiler (tsc).
```
tsc index.ts
```
3. Type Checking
    >TypeScript performs type checking during the compilation process and flags errors before you run the code.

4. tsconfig.json
    > This file is used to configure the TypeScript project, specifying compiler options, file inclusions, and exclusions.
